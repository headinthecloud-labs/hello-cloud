## ✨ Mission Statement

Head in the Cloud Labs exists to publicly document my journey from “cloud-curious” to certified Cloud Security Engineer.  
By sharing every experiment, design decision, and lesson learned, I aim to:

1. **Learn by building** secure, scalable AWS infrastructure in the open.  

2. **Give back** through open-source modules and templates that make cloud security simpler for everyone. Hopefully...
